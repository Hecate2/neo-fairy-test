Let https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/blob/master/src/RpcServer/RpcServer.csproj include the file `RpcServer.WithSession.cs`. Compile and run your own RpcServer in your local neo-cli node. 

You can execute transactions and save your snapshots in neo-cli's memory. Access these snapshots with session strings defined by yourself.
